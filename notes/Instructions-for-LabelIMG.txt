Hello! Welcome to the LabelImg installation guide!
The purpose of this guide is to help you create bounding boxes for whatever is found amongst images you provide.
Following these next few steps will help you install the software needed to use the LabelImg application. 

1. Download python[3.7.1] Installer for your computer[Windows 10]

[RECOMMENDED] 64-bit https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.1/python-3.7.1-amd64.exe
OR
32-bit https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.1/python-3.7.1.exe

2. Run the Installer. Ensure you checkmark the "Add Python 3.7 to PATH" at the beginning of the installation process.

3. Copy all files from THIS repository. This can be done by clicking on the green "Clone or Download" button on the right side of the screen.
   It will then provide a blue-text "Download ZIP" option. 
   Click on that option and download the ZIP file onto your Desktop[or somplace easy to access].
   Extract the contents of the ZIP file and move onto step 4.

4. At this point you now have the application software for LabelImg and a programming language[Python 3.7.1] to interpret this software, however, there are a few missing libraries that need to be installed. 

5. To install these missing libraries, we will use "pip install" in your command window.

6. Open a command window and enter the following commands individually:

			pip install lxml 
			pip install pyqt5

7. That should be all of the libraries needed. 
8. Now navigate to the extracted ZIP file contents. The file "labelImg.py" should be found in >>/Extracted_ZIP_File/labelImg-1.5.2/labelImg.py

9. Double click on labelImg.py to begin annotating! 

10. Additional help:
	If Double clicking the file "labelImg.py" fails to open the application, you may be able to identify the error by:
		1. open a command window and change directory's to said file.
		2. run "python labelImg.py" once you are there.
		3. read the error's

	If you see an "Import Error: DLL load failed when importing PyQt5" then you have installed the incorrect Python in step 1. Go through all the steps again and see if the application opens then. 

	If you see a ModuleNotFoundError, you did not pip install said Module.
