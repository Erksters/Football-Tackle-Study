This Program was created for research purposes at Kansas State University by Erick Saenz under the supervision of Dr.Hsu and in collaboration with Dr. Scott Dietrich

The overall goal of this project is as follows:
   Accurately measure tackling proficiency amoung youth by the Standardized Assessment of Tackling Technique (SATT) with Machines (Computer Vision)

The subgoals to accomplish this goal are as follows:
  Identify a player before they tackle accurately
  Determine if the shins and back of the player are parallel
  etc...
  
All python files should be able to run independently. They will typically ask for the desired video to work on when ran.
